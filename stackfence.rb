  # If @stackfence is set, calling this method with a block
  # will result in a pseudo-random value getting pushed onto
  # the stack, and on return from the block, that value is
  # compared against the top of the stack. If a match if found,
  # all is well and the value is removed from the stack.
  #
  # Otherwise `trace` is called (FIXME: and a way of forcing trace
  # output needs to be added) with an error message. 
  #
  # This provides some validation both that the stack is not
  # pushed/popped unevenly, and that values are not overwritten.
